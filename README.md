The project seen in this file was created over a semester and included Financial and Database (SQL) fundamentals for the proposition of a business. The business in reference was referred to as "SellMe" and online shopping platform for consigned goods in a collaborative space. The project was directed and excuted independently and allowed for an in-depth database construction with elaborate business rules to prompt functions. The proposal seen above is the final attachment for the innerworkings of the company and how the software built a functional and operational business. The proposal includes the business venture and what is achieved through the creation of the platform and also the construction of various Database related diagrams to program the settings.
